## Getting and Cleaning Data
Daniel Bober

Repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project submission.

### Overview
Demonstrates the reading and cleaning of a data set so that it conforms to "tidy data" standards

### Modifying this Code
After reading in the source files, modify line 10 of the code to reflect your own directory where the files are stored.

### Project Summary
Description of the project instructions as follows:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
- 1) Merge the training data set and the test data set into one data set
- 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- 4) Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a separate, independent, tidy data set w/ the avg of each variable for each activity and each subject


### Additional Information
Information about the variables and details about the run_analysis.R script can be found in the CodeBook.md file.
